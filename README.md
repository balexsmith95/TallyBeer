#TallyBeer

This is a website I built as a project in college. It aggregated the beers & breweries local to Tallahassee, FL, and allowed users to create an account, rate beers, and search for local bars that sold a particular brew.
It uses HTML & JS on the frontend, with PHP & MySQL on the backend, and PHPMyAdmin for database admin.
